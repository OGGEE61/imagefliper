"# Image Flipper
The Image Flipper is a Python application that allows you to flip images horizontally or vertically. By using the Python Imaging Library (PIL), the application opens an image file, performs the desired flip, displays both the original and flipped images, and saves the flipped image as a new file. It provides a simple and convenient way to visually manipulate images through Python scripting.

Usage
1. Install the required dependencies by running pip install Pillow in your terminal or command prompt.
2. Replace 'test1.jpg' in the code with the actual path to your image file.
3. Specify the desired flip direction as either 'horizontal' or 'vertical'.
4. Run the script and observe the original and flipped images.
5. The flipped image will be saved as 'flipped_image.jpg' in the current directory.

Please note that this application currently supports JPEG images. Feel free to modify the code to handle other image formats if needed.

Enjoy flipping your images with ease using the Image Flipper Python application!
